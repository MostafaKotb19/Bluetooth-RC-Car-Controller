*Bluetooth-Controlled RC Car*


*Overview:*


- The Bluetooth-Controlled RC Car project allows users to remotely control a miniature car using their mobile devices. The project utilizes Bluetooth technology to establish a wireless connection between the RC car and a dedicated mobile application, enabling users to send commands and control the car's movements.


*Features:*


- Wireless control: The RC car can be controlled wirelessly using a mobile device via Bluetooth.
- Precise movements: The car responds accurately to user commands, allowing for precise control over its movements.
- Speed control: The mobile application allows users to adjust the car's speed according to their preference or the operating environment.


*Hardware Requirements:*


- RC car chassis
- Arduino UNO
- Bluetooth module
- Motors and motor drivers
- Mobile device (smartphone or tablet)
- Microchip Studio for programming the microcontroller


*Installation and Setup:*


- Clone the project repository to your local machine.
- Upload the firmware code to the microcontroller using the Microchip Studio.
- Install the custom mobile application on your mobile device (Bluetooth RC Car).
- Turn on the RC car and ensure that the Bluetooth module is powered and discoverable.
- Launch the mobile application and establish a Bluetooth connection with the RC car.
- Once connected, you can use the mobile application to control the RC car's movements.
